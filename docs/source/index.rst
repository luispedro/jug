What is Jug?
------------

Jug allows you to write code that is broken up into tasks and run different
tasks on different processors.

It currently has two backends. The first uses the filesystem to communicate
between processes and works correctly over NFS, so you can coordinate processes
on different machines. The second is based on redis so the processes only need
the capability to connect to a common redis server.

Jug also takes care of saving all the intermediate results to the backend in a
way that allows them to be retrieved later.



Examples
--------

Short Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a one minute example. Save the following to a file called ``primes.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/primes/primes.py

Of course, this is only for didactical purposes, normally you would use a
better method. Similarly, the ``sleep`` function is so that it does not run too
fast.

Now type ``jug status primes.py`` to get::


     Waiting       Ready    Finished     Running  Task name                    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           1           0           0           0  primes.count_primes          
           0          99           0           0  primes.is_prime              
           1           0           0           0  primes.write_output          
    ...........................................................................
           2          99           0           0  Total                        




This tells you that you have 99 tasks called ``primes.is_prime`` ready to run,
while both other tasks are _waiting_ (i.e., they need the ``primes.is_prime``
tasks to finish).  So run ``jug execute primes.py &``. You can even run
multiple instances in the background (if you have multiple cores, for example).
After starting 4 instances and waiting a few seconds, you can check the status
again (with ``jug status primes.py``)::


     Waiting       Ready    Finished     Running  Task name                    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           1           0           0           0  primes.count_primes          
           0          63          32           4  primes.is_prime              
           1           0           0           0  primes.write_output          
    ...........................................................................
           2          99           0           0  Total                        


Now you have 32 tasks finished, 4 running, and 63 still ready. Eventually, they
will all finish (including ``count_primes`` and ``write_output`) and you can
inspect the results with ``jug shell primes.py``.  This will give you an
``ipython`` shell. The `primes100` variable is available, but it is an ugly
list of `jug.Task` objects. To get the actual value, you call the `value`
function::

    In [1]: primes100 = value(primes100)

    In [2]: primes100[:10]
    Out[2]: [True, True, False, True, False, True, False, False, False, True]

the `examples/` directory.
